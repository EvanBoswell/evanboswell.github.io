    <h1>Video Game Design</h1>
    <p><strong>The Design of Video Games</strong> has been a intersets of my ever since I play my one computer game 
	which being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_III:_Reign_of_Chaos" target="_blank">Warcraft 3</a>.
      I remeber loading up the game and being amazed by the creative and interseting world that the game took 
      place in. The story and gameplay of each of the factions in the game are quite unique to each other. After
	playing warcraft I always wanted to make my own video game with <strong>amazing worldbuilding and excellent gameplay
	mechanics to make a engaging game and story.</strong></p>
